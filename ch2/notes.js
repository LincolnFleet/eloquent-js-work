/** Program Structure
 * 
 * expression: fragment of code that produces a value, can contain other expressions
 * statement: conclusive set of expressions, often ended with semicolon
 * side-effects: changes or effects on surrounding code/environment caused by a statement
 * binding (or) variable: a name that references a value. Vars which point to expressions actually point to the resulting value of the expression
 * environment: the full set of bindings in a program at a given point in time
 * control flow: a sequence of statements that can be executed in a program
