Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

- all objects have properties, null and undefined being the exceptions
- access properties with dot or bracket notation (obj.prop or obj['prop'])
- obj[prop] evaluates `prop` expression and converts the return to a string
- properties that are functions are called methods
- Object is an arbitrary collection of properties
- properties can be added, removed, updated, accessed in any order, and can point to a value of any type
- properties reference values, and do not hold the values themselves
- `delete` operator removes a property from an object
- `in` operator checks if a property exists in an object
- `for...in` loops through all properties of an object
- `Object.assign("key", value)` adds a property to an object
- probability table for coincidence of a true/false feature and a true/false result
	- "phi" ϕ = n11*n00 − n10*n01 / √(n1?*n0?*n?1*n?0)	// float > -1 && float < 1
	- n01 is the count of the number of times the first feature is false and the second is true
- `for ... of` loops through all properties of an array
