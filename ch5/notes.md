Higher Order Functions

- functions are first class objects, can be passed around like values
- functions that take other functions as arguments, or return functions are called higher-order functions
- filtering removes items from a list based on if they pass a test
- map creates a new list after applying a function to each item in an existing list
- reduce applies a function to each item in a list and returns a single values
- composability is the concept of writing simple, single-responsibility functions so that they can be combined into more complicated operations
- strings can be looped over like arrays
